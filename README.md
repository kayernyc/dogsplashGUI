## Dog GUI

### Quick start
To build and run this project, clone the repo, cd into the folder, and run:

```
npm i && npm start
```

then navigate to `http://localhost:1234/`.

This project uses Parcel, Typescript, and Node to create a small GUI for looking at dogs from:

https://dog.ceo/dog-api/

Most dog breeds are represented by hundreds of photos, but a few are under-represented, notably the Australian shepards and Akitas.

Test coverage, with Jest, is partial at this point, but can be run with:
```
npm run test
```
